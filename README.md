# Disputes_and_complains_regarding_financial_services
Trying to predict if a costumer will start a dispute after a complain regarding financial services. Data extracted from: Consumer Financial Protection Financial Bureau.
Each week are send thousands of consumersâ€™ complaints about financial products and services to companies for response. Those complaints are published after the company responds or after 15 days, whichever comes first.

"Every complaint provides insight into problems that people are experiencing, helping us identify inappropriate practices and allowing us to stop them before they become major issues." https://www.consumerfinance.gov/data-research/consumer-complaints/
